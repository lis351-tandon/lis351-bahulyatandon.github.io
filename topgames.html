				<h2>Top 3 Free Games</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>Splitgate</h3>
						<p>Have you ever played Portal? Are you instead a more FPS player? Well there comes Splitgate - A First person shooter made but you can create portals. Run around, create portals, juke the players to stab them in the back. Splitgate is one of the most fun, free to play FPS game in current times.

						<p>What is created when a bunch of Otaku(s) come together to create a game? miHoYo has estabilished a free to play, open world game with the gacha factor hidden inside it in Genshin Impact. A game created not only for PC and the Playstation but also mobile.

						<p>Out of the many FPS shooter games created over the past few years, Valorant by RIOT Games stands at one of the most popular FPS games. Imagine playing Counter Strike but with super powers - that is something Valorant goes for. Every character has it's own abilities in this 5v5 team based shooter and these abilities are as important as aim to win the game.</p>

				<h2>Top 3 Paid Games</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>Minecraft</h3>
						<p>First released as early as 2011, Minecraft has estabilished it's place in the gaming community as one of the best, everlasting and enjoyable games to have ever been made. Creating an open world, consisting of 3 different realms, namely Overworld, Nether and the End, Minecraft is a paradise for the player's creativity because it is quite literally anything you want to make, you can. And with it's recent updates, it's just getting better.</p>
					</li>

					<li><h3>Jackbox</h3>
						<p>With the world still recovering from the pandemic, people are still maintaining social distance, and what better entertainment for friends than playing games with each other online? Jackbox Party Packs are definitely one of the best party games to have been created and with their new and updating party packs there's always something to look forward to. Games that include things from drawing to speed dating but with monster powers, Jackbox has a lot to offer and definitely something to suit the mood.</p>
					</li>

					<li><h3>Zero Escape: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors</h3>
						<p>As a fan of visual novels and escape rooms, this is one of the best games with an intriguing story I've played. Zero Escape is a death game based on Escape Rooms where 9 people have 9 hours to escape a slowly sinking ship and have to go through 9 locked doors to escape the ship and survive. With a total of 7 different endings, where each one leaves you with more to think about and sets the mood perfectly for the player to retry to completely understand what's happening in the story, I can definitely say there's enough content to keep you interested and play the game for about 20 hours.</p>
