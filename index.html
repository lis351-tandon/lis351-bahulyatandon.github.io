				<h3><span class = "emphasized">Elden Ring</span></h3>
				<p>The new hot-shot of 2022, Elden Ring has recorded more than 950,000 players actively playing the game on the second weekend after it's release. Elden Ring's difficulty is something that people have acclaimed to match the Dark Souls series, one of the most infamously hard games that have ever existed. However hard the game might be, it comes with it's benefits over the Dark Souls series with some of them being much more impactful than others. Elden Ring has "Sites of Grace", or checkpoints in each world area, rarely having the players spend several minutes returning to where they died.</p>

				<h3><span class = "emphasized">Pokemon Legends Arceus</span></h3>
				<p>Taking inspiration from games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and from Pokemon Go, Nintendo came out with a game that captures the real essence of Pokemon. Pokemon Legends Arceus(PLA) is a purely open world game that has the pokemon spawn in the open world like Pokemon Go, and conducts all the battles in the open world itself. PLA leaves behind the concept of gyms and Pokemon Battling to get stronger, and instead focuses on a story in the far past when humans were afraid of living in a world full of Pokemon.</p>
