    		<p>Here is a clip from Genshin Impact where I fight against the boss Pyro Hypostasis and try to kill him mainly by dealing damage using my character Xingqiu. I use Mona to destroy Pyro shield and then use the other characters Bennett and Sara Kujou to boost my damage that I will deal using Xingqiu. Then I switch to Xingqiu to deal a massive 250k+ damage.</p>
